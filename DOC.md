Little-endian:
This format stores the least significant byte of a multi-byte data item at the lowest memory address. It's used by Intel x86 processors (found in most PCs and many mobile devices) and is also the default in many operating systems. 

Big-endian:
In this format, the most significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address. It's dominant in network protocols (often referred to as "network byte order") and some older architectures and systems, including some IBM mainframes. 

Interoperability:
The existence of both formats necessitates the use of conversion functions (like htons and ntohs in network programming) to ensure data is interpreted correctly when systems with different endianness communicate.
